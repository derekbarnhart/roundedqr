roundedqr
=========

Creates rounded QR codes using the PHP QR Code library

Please see original at the following link:
[phpQRCode project](http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/)

This this was a proof of concept I built a while back when I was exploring new technologies in QR.

The QRIllustrator class contains all the rendering logic.

Don't expect it to be clean or commented. Sorry. If I decide to take it further I will probably rewrite the engine to provide for more flexibility.
